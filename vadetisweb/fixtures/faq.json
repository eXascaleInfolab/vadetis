        "question": "What is the difference between real-world and synthetic datasets?",
        "answer": "The datasets are devided into these two categories in order to define whether they are based on real data or if they are artifically created by an algorithm."

        "question": "What is the difference between spatial and non spatial datasets?",
        "answer": "Spatial datasets require additional geographic information about the recording location of each time series. If spatial data is available you can perform LISA algorithm using spatial distances as weights between the time series."

        "question": "I have missing values in my datasets. Is this a problem?",
        "answer": "Yes, if a value is missing at a certain timestamp some algorithms cannot compute a detection result at this timestamp and therefor it is required to have no gaps in the data. There exist several techniques to recover missing values such as <a href=\\\"http://revival.exascale.info/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">centroid decomposition</a>."

        "question": "What is the impact if the time series in a dataset recorded attributes in different domains?",
        "answer": "If time series recorded different related domains, e.g. temperature and radiation, the values are transformed into z-scores and the anomaly detection algorithm will perform on these z-score values and not the raw data."

        "answer": "The CSV file of supervised data must include a <strong>ts_name;time;unit;value;class</strong> header where 'ts_name' is the name of the time series, 'time' the timestamp in UTC, 'unit' the unit of the values and value' the value of the measurement. The 'class' field is a boolean that indicates if the current value at a given timestamp is considered an anomaly (1) or not (0). The file must use semicolons as delimiter and all time series of your dataset must be contained in this single file. Of course, the time series names must be distinct within the same dataset. Further, the timestamps between series must be aligned."

The 'ts_name' is the name of the time series, 'l_name' is the recording location name, lat' the latitude and 'lon' the longitude in decimal degrees of the location. The ch1903 values are based on Swiss coordinate system and expect values in meters. 'Height' indicates meters over sea level at the recording location."

        "question": "I performed the same configuration for anomaly detection multiple times, but I get different results. Why?",
        "answer": "It depends on the selected training data when Vadetis is evaluating the model for outlier detection. If you don't define a random seed, training data is selected in a full random fashion out of the training dataset. \r\nThis may lead to different results. Vadetis will select the same training data for a given random seed."
