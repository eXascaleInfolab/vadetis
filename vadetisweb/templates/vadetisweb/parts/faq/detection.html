                    <strong>Histogram, Cluster, SVM, Isolation Forest:</strong><br/>
                    These methods use the selected proportion of normal data instances in the training dataset for semi-supervised learning.
                    The rest of the normal data as well as outlier instances will be split by the given proportion to a validation set. For
                    example: with a dataset of 1000 data instances containing 60 outlier instances and a proportion of 0.5, then the
                    training set will contain 470 normal data instances, whereas the validation set contains 235 normal and 30 outlier
                    instances. The validation set is used to determine the decision boundary (threshold). Data instances with a score below
                    the threshold will be marked as anomalies.

                    <strong>RPCA:</strong><br/>
                    Training on RPCA directly splits the training data by the given proportion into a training and validation set
                    so that both sets share the same level of contamination. Then, the model is fitted with the given training set computing
                    the principal components and applied to the validation set reducing the dimensions. Afterwards the data is translated
                    back to the original dimension space. The outliers scores are computed from the reconstruction error and the most
                    appropriate decision boundary is set. Data instances with a score above the threshold will be marked as outliers.

                    <strong>LISA:</strong><br/>
                    LISA is a statistical method that does not require training and is directly applied to the data.
